DRL model:
Stories which got to admire:4372
Total stories generated: 4423
Percentage of stories getting to admire: 98.84%

Lines to get to admire: 11589
Average lines to get to admire (in stories which did) = 2.65

Forward (Pre-trained) model:
Stories which got to admire: 357
Total stories generated: 4423
Percentage of stories getting to admire: 8.07%

Lines to get to admire: 1894
Average lines to get to admire (in stories which did) = 5.30532212885

The above two were done by putting each line in the test data as input to the model and generating a story from that. If within 10 lines the model didn't get to admire, it is assumed that for this input the story won't get to admire and we go on to the next input.

Full Genre68 combined corpus stats (Here we have considered the entire corpus - Train+Test data):
Setting 1 - Do not reset counter on finding admire (which means if a story has admire occuring 3 times, for each one of them the count of lines added will be from <start of story>. The averaging has been correctly handled so don't worry about that):
Number of lines to get to admire - 14971
Number of stories to use for avergaing - 563

Number of stories that have admire in them - 356 
(This number differs from the number above because admire comes multiple times in stories - 
We don't want to count them multiple times here)
Total number of stories - 1063

Avg lines to get to admire - 26.59
Avg percentage of stories that have admire in it - 33.49%

Setting 2 - Reset the line counter when you see admire (which means if a story has admire occuring 3 times, for each one of them the count of lines added will be from the previous admire and not <start of story>, which makes sense too):
Everything is the same as Setting 1. Only change:
Number of lines to get to admire - 9315

Thus, the avg lines to get to admire becomes = 16.54

Setting 3:
Max_lines = 10
Num_stories (total lines in training combined file) = 34065
Got to admire = 4839
Lines count = 25617

Percentage of stories getting to admire = 14.21%
Avg lines to get to admire = 5.29

Max_lines = 20
Num_stories (total lines in training combined file) = 34065
Got to admire = 8837
Lines count = 87073

Percentage of stories getting to admire = 25.94%
Avg lines to get to admire = 9.85

Max_lines = 30
Num_stories (total lines in training combined file) = 34065
Got to admire = 12276
Lines count = 174386

Percentage of stories getting to admire = 36.04%
Avg lines to get to admire = 14.21
